**Hi, my name is Vade! I am a computer scientist, political scienctist, and linguist!**

I am a recent graduate of UW-Madison with coursework in software security, database management, and neural networks, as well as campaign finance.
I work on the [Digital Linguistics][dlx] (DLx) project, which provides data formats and web-based tools for working with linguistic data.

Additionally, I worked on the [Algonquian Components Project][components] as a researcher, developer, and data handler. The project is a National Science Foundationâ€“funded database of morphological
components in Algonquian languages, which uses the Digital Linguistics infrastructure.
